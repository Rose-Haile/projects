This folder contains some work I did in 2017 with laser cutting to make jewelry. I discovered the foldable laser cut template while researching laser cutting techniques, and noticing how nice it looked, decided to use it to make some bracelets. After much trial and error (the finished versions shown here are the 4th or 5th iteration of the design) I was able to intersperse the less flexible but more pleasing omnidirectional design with a slightly more fragile but also much more flexible single-directional flexible wood. The matching earrings and necklace were created later due to spare materials. Photos were taken by me.
