This folder contains work that I did for the Carnegie Mellon University's summer Pre-College Design program. In week 4, we focused on digital design. These posters were designed for Ugly CSA, a program where odd-looking produce was sold cheaply. The 'ugly csa' font is my design, meant to be particularly eye-catching and designed with a simple set of blocky shapes. The vegetable images were photographs, sourced from various creative commons imagebases, and then converted to monochrome bitmaps of various colors.
