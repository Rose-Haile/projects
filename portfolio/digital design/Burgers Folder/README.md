This folder contains what is perhaps one of my most interesting projects, an 8-page concept zine about burgers that was done for a digital design class that I took in 2019. It's best viewed as double-page spreads since several of the images are meant to be viewed in this way. In this piece, I really tried to express bold shapes and colors, to give an extremely vibrant feel to the backgrounds, and dominated the rest with pop-art inspired images and graphics. All graphics were created by me, and the photographs were sourced from reuse-approved sites.
